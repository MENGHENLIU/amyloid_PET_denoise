# NCU graduation project - Synthesis late phase Amyloid PET Image with Under-sampled Data

**Abstract:**

_We apply U-net to synthesize 20 minutes late phase amyloid PET image using 5 minutes image.  

**Conclution:**

_judging from PSNR, SSIM and RMSE, the image quality has indeed improved.

## Set up

Here are some set up recommendation.

### Anaconda

By the time we finish this project, we're using Anaconda 2019.07. It's not required to download this specific version. Nwer version should work just fine.  

### Python requirements

After downloading Anaconda, please create a clean environment and install library dependencies:

```
conda create -n tf2.4 python=3.8
activate tf2.4
pip install tensorflow==2.4.0
pip install tensorflow_gpu==2.4.0
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
conda install pydot
```

Next, please download pydot from [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/) for model visualization.

## Download data

We used data from [OASIS3](https://www.oasis-brains.org/). After acquiring authorization from OASIS, please download all AV45-PET-.nii data.
