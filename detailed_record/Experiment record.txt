#AIM
1. validate Unet in predicting ground thruth image (50-70min) from single time frame image(50-55min) by SSIM, PSNR, and RMSE param.
2. discuss prediction performance (via SSIM PSNR RMSE)

#Material
1. OASIS 
 -total n=355
 -training n=325
 -testing n=30 (positive=15/ negative=15)
   
#Method
a.Normalization
 1. early phase input(STF): f23
 2. ground truth(GT): avg[f23-26]
 3. normalize STF and GT by max[STF,GT]:
  1)
   STF = STF/(max[STF,GT]/2) -1
   GT  = GT /(max[STF,GT]/2) -1
   result => STF and GT convert from [0,40000~] to [-1,1] (almost every data)
	
  2)
   In case of negative numbers in original images, set any number below -1 to -1 and above 1 to 1. In order to prevent saturation.
   result => [-1,1] (every data)
   
b. We choose U-net and L1 loss for the model architecture.
c. All output images rescale from [-1,1] to value[0,1] for display and evaluation.
d. Evaluates SSIM, PSNR, and RMSE via 3D volume with GT cutoff 0.1 among [0,1](SSIM didn't apply cutoff).

#Results
a. 3D nii of STF, P and GT (n=30) (each value=[0,1])
b. SSIM, PSNR, RMSE param between (STF/GT) and (P/GT)
   
   (Figure 1)
   a. positive example STF, P, GT (highest SSIM)
   b. positive example STF, P, GT (lowest  SSIM)
   c. negative example STF, P, GT (highest SSIM)
   d. negative example STF, P, GT (lowest  SSIM)
   
   (Figure 2)
   a. PSNR, SSIM, RMSE of total
   b. PSNR, SSIM, RMSE of positive
   c. PSNR, SSIM, RMSE of negative
   
#Conclusion
{SSIM, PSNR and RMSE of P and GT} have better average results than {SSIM, PSNR and RMSE of STF and GT}.
Further clinical value should be evaluated.
